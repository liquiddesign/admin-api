# 💫🅐 Admin LqGrAphi

GraphQL API for [liquiddesign/admin](https://github.com/liquiddesign/admin) using [liquiddesign/lqgraphi](https://github.com/liquiddesign/lqgraphi).

Recommended approach is use only types and config from this package and make your own API project.<br>
But if you want you can use this package as standalone API, all needed resources for that are bundled.
